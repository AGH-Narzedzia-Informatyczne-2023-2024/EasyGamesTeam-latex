\subsection{Pokemon - Charmander}

\begin{flushleft}
\texttt{ Charmander} (see Figure \ref{fig:pokemon}) is a \underline{Fire type Pokémon} introduced in Generation~1.

\texttt{ Charmander} is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. Most of its body is colored orange, while its underbelly is light yellow and it has blue eyes. It has a flame at the end of its tail, which is said to signify its health.

\texttt{ Charmander's} design is based on a lizard, however as its name suggests it may also have been inspired by salamanders, which in mythology have an affinity with fire.

(See Table \ref{tab:pok_stats} for pokemon stats)

\textit{
Charmander is notable for being one of the three choices for a starter Pokémon in the original Game Boy games, Pokémon Red \& Blue (Red~\&~Green~in~Japan), along with Bulbasaur and Squirtle.}
